# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Using LSTM

## Overview
This project applies Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for stock market analysis and price prediction. It utilizes historical stock market data to train an LSTM model and forecast future stock prices.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- LSTM-based time series forecasting
- Model evaluation using loss metrics
- Predictions plotted against actual data

## Dataset
The dataset includes historical stock price data with the following fields:
- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Adj Close
- Volume

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook stock_market_analysis_prediction_using_lstm.ipynb
```
Follow the notebook's instructions to preprocess the data, train the model, and visualize results.

## Results
The trained LSTM model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and plotted predictions for validation.

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
- Integration with live stock market data
- Implementation of other deep learning models (e.g., GRU, Transformer)
